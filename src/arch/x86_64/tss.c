/* The Task-State Segment (TSS).
 *
 *  Instances of the TSS, an x86-64 specific structure, are used to
 *  define "tasks", a form of support for multitasking built right
 *  into the processor.  However, for various reasons including
 *  portability, speed, and flexibility, most x86-64 OSes almost
 *  completely ignore the TSS.  We are no exception.
 *
 *  Unfortunately, there is one thing that can only be done using
 *  a TSS: stack switching for interrupts that occur in user mode.
 *  When an interrupt occurs in user mode (ring 3), the processor
 *  consults the rsp0 members of the current TSS to determine the
 *  stack to use for handling the interrupt.  Thus, we must create
 *  a TSS and initialize at least these fields, and this is
 *  precisely what this file does.
 *
 *  When an interrupt is handled by an interrupt or trap gate
 *  (which applies to all interrupts we handle), an x86-64 processor
 *  works like this:
 *
 *    - If the code interrupted by the interrupt is in the same
 *      ring as the interrupt handler, then no stack switch takes
 *      place.  This is the case for interrupts that happen when
 *      we're running in the kernel.  The contents of the TSS are
 *      irrelevant for this case.
 *
 *    - If the interrupted code is in a different ring from the
 *      handler, then the processor switches to the stack
 *      specified in the TSS for the new ring.  This is the case
 *      for interrupts that happen when we're in user space.  It's
 *      important that we switch to a stack that's not already in
 *      use, to avoid corruption.  Because we're running in user
 *      space, we know that the current process's kernel stack is
 *      not in use, so we can always use that.  Thus, when the
 *      scheduler switches threads, it also changes the TSS's
 *      stack pointer to point to the new thread's kernel stack.
 *      (The call is in schedule in thread.c.) */
